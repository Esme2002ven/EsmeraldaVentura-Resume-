        Hello! My name is Esmeralda Ventura and I am 19 years old. I am currently a full time student at the University of California, Riverside. I am a sophomore working on my Bachelors in Psychology. I am currently volunteering as a first year peer mentor. I am the mentor to first year students who need help adjusting or transitioning to college life. This includes meeting with them once a week to discuss how things are going for them and what I can do to help them. I provide them with any tools or resources they might need to help them. If they need help with school work, then I can help then with giving them the number of website to the ARC program or other tutoring programs on campus. If they need help with housing, then I lead them to campus housing and get them the information they may need to get the answers to their questions. I also help give them advice on how to manage their time and even making friends. I have a lot experience in things like this because of other volunteer programs I have done prior years. In my high school years I would volunteer at a local church by helping with task they had no one else would do. This included running a small store they would put up to raise funds for the church. On some days I would run the cashier and gained experience behind the counter. I also helped stocking and doing inventory. The owner and I would go through all the inventory and check in the sales matched how much inventory was missing as well as helping her put in new orders for future merchandise. I also helped the owner do her financial work because she was older and needed help counting. I would fill out her forms with all the information of what was sold that day and what income would go to what inside the church. I would also help the church in childcare of smaller children. Most of the parents of the church were family friends, so they trusted me to take of the children. I would collaborate with the teachers and volunteer as their assistants. I work well with others and would get the job done. Besides this, I also did volunteer work in high school such as blood drives, link crew and several clubs. Link crew is kind of like the peer mentorship program at UCR. We would collaborate and as leaders we would find ways to help the students transitions to high school smoother. For the blood drive, I volunteered as a patient buddy which would help people just getting out from being with the doctor get to the resting area and carrying their stuff because they were still weak.  <br><br>
